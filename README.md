## Google Play Compliance
In order to comply with the latest Google Play policies surrounding the use of certain permissions, 
the core functionality of the app cannot be published on Google Play. [See more details](https://github.com/midhunhk/message-counter/wiki/Permissions#removal-from-google-play)   
To make the app available to all users, it needs to be installed from an [alternate source](https://github.com/midhunhk/message-counter/wiki/Alternate-Sources).  
Note that restriction applies to all apps on Google Play Store.
